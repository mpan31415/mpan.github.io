<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Masters student in Robotics, Systems and Control at **ETH Zürich**, tutored by [Prof. Robert Riener](https://sms.hest.ethz.ch/the-group/team/robert-riener.html).

I am interested in enabling robots to efficiently and robustly interact with people and objects in the world through technical methods from the areas of control and learning. I plan to conduct research across the [Sensory-Motor Systems Lab](https://sms.hest.ethz.ch/) and the [Robotics Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) at ETH as part of my Masters studies.

I graduated from **The University of Melbourne**, Australia with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechatronics Engineering (First-class Honors). I completed my Bachelor's thesis project under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Eden](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/453579-jonathan-eden), [Dr. Wafa Johal](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/892823-wafa-johal-benkaouar-johal) and [Prof. Denny Oetomo](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/188333-denny-oetomo), and continued working as a research assistant in the Human-Robot Interaction group focusing on human-robot shared control and teleoperation. I was also previously a research assistant in the Robotics group at **Monash University** working on integrated grasp and trajectory optimization for robotic arms, supervised by [Dr. Akansel Cosgun](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/akanselcosgun) and [Dr. James Saunderson](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/jamessaunderson).
