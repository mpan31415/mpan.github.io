<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a MSc Student in Robotics, Systems and Control at **ETH Zürich**, tutored by [Prof. Robert Riener](https://sms.hest.ethz.ch/the-group/team/robert-riener.html).

I am interested in applying AI and machine learning methods to the design and control of assistive robots and human-robot shared autonomy. I conduct research in the Sensory-Motor Systems Lab and Robotics Systems Lab at ETH as part of my Masters studies.

I graduated from The University of Melbourne, Australia with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechatronics Engineering (First-class Honors). I completed my Bachelor's thesis project under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Eden](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/453579-jonathan-eden), [Dr. Wafa Johal](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/892823-wafa-johal-benkaouar-johal) and [Prof. Denny Oetomo](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/188333-denny-oetomo). I was a research assistant in the Human-Robot Interaction group at The University of Melbourne working on shared-autonomy and cognitive load. I was also previously a research assistant in the Robotics group at Monash University working on Integrated Grasp and Trajectory Optimization for robotic arms.
