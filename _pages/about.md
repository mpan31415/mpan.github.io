<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Masters student in Robotics, Systems and Control at **ETH Zürich**, tutored by [Prof. Robert Riener](https://sms.hest.ethz.ch/the-group/team/robert-riener.html).

I am interested in enabling robots to efficiently and robustly interact with people and objects in the world through technical methods from the areas of control and learning. I plan to conduct research across the [Sensory-Motor Systems Lab](https://sms.hest.ethz.ch/) and the [Robotics Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) at ETH as part of my Masters studies.

I graduated from **The University of Melbourne**, Australia with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechatronics Engineering (First-class Honors). I completed my Bachelor's thesis project under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Eden](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/453579-jonathan-eden), [Dr. Wafa Johal](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/892823-wafa-johal-benkaouar-johal) and [Prof. Denny Oetomo](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/188333-denny-oetomo), and continued working as a research assistant in the Human-Robot Interaction group focusing on human-robot shared control and teleoperation. I was also previously a research assistant in the Robotics group at **Monash University** working on integrated grasp and trajectory optimization for robotic arms, supervised by [Dr. Akansel Cosgun](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/akanselcosgun) and [Dr. James Saunderson](https://www.monash.edu/engineering/jamessaunderson).

# 🛠️ Fun Projects 

| Project       | Visualization       |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Rocket docking maneuver** with collision avoidance. Trajectory generation and optimization using **Sequential Convex Programming**. Implementation follows the paper, [Convex Optimization for Trajectory Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09125). | ![rocket docking GIF](assets/project_gifs/rocket_docking.gif)  |
| **Autonomous lane-changing maneuver** in a highway driving scenario. Implementation uses the [Intelligent Driver Model](https://mtreiber.de/MicroApplet/IDM.html), search and planning with motion primitives, and PID control.  | ![lane changing GIF](assets/project_gifs/lane_changing.gif)  |
| **Monocular Visual Odometry pipeline** for urban driving scenarios. Implementation includes SIFT, Harris, Shi-Tomasi, and FAST feature detectors, KLT optical-flow tracker for feature tracking, Kalman filter for enhanced camera motion estimation. Tuned and tested on the **KITTI**, **Malaga**, and **Parking** datasets, and a custom dataset recorded on the **Polybahn** in Zürich. Screencasts of the VO pipeline running on all datasets can be found on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiDPZti1iaQoReVg7OTpJDtQifOGpUsB2). | ![VO pipeline GIF](assets/project_gifs/vo_pipeline.gif)  |
